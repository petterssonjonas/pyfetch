# |_|    |___/ Yet another Linux system information fetcher.
#              Inspired by Neofetch (Bash), pfetch (bash), screenfetch (Bash),
#              paleofetch (C), pyFetch (py, by bn0x unmentained), pyfetch (py, 
#              pip-info-fetcher). 
#              pyFetch is meant to be more configurable than most others.
#              As a every time i open a terminal execution i would recomend
#              using Paleofetch, it is extremly fast.

This is but a hobby project. Started some time ago as a way to learn python.
Fiddled with it lately and decided to make a repo.

pyFetch is a W.I.P.
A few modules are not implemented yet. The config system is not started on.
I intend to add add ascii logos and colors for many distros.
